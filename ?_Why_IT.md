# About me
With almost a decade of successful experience in various management roles across different industries, I possess strong adaptability and the ability to thrive in new environments. After the Krakow project, I deliberately decided to redirect my professional pursuits toward the new technologies industry that has a high work culture, structured processes, and an international environment. I always leverage my diverse background, newly acquired knowledge, and interpersonal skills to bring value to the field.

I know the importance of gaining technical knowledge in the field. I focused my first efforts on learning about software testing and I received the ISTQB certification. 
Additionally, Iâ€™m learning Java to expand my knowledge of automation testing. 

In the future, I aim to continue developing my skills in the tech industry, particularly in project management, product management, negotiations, customer relations, and new business.
